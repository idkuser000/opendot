# opendot
Hello! This is my personal Openbox setup.

# Necessary Dependencies
- `urxvt`: Terminal
- `openbox`, `sxhkd`: Window manager & shortcut manager
- `bash`, `zsh`: Shell
- `dunst`: Notification
- `tint2`: Bar
- `rofi`: Launcher
- `Comic Mono`, `Symbols Nerd Font`: Fonts

# Installation (manually)
1. Install all the necessary dependencies
2. Clone the repository
3. Type "cd opendot" in your terminal
4. Copy all folders in "config" to your user's config folder (~/.config)
5. Copy all folders in "usr/share/themes" to your system's /usr/share/themes
6. Copy the "local/share/rofi/themes/light.rasi" to your system's ".local/share/rofi/themes" (you may need to create that folder first)
7. Open "Rofi Theme Selector" then type light, then press Enter and press Alt+A

Also, thanks Stardust-kyun! The bar and the theme was heavily inspired/taken by his repository.

This is my first time upload a dotfile to GitHub, so it is still incomplete. If you had any problems, DMs to my Discord: thetfs0! :)
